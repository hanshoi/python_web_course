# Getting Started

You will need some set of tools to work with. I will recommend something that
will provide the best base for you for the whole duration of your career as
python web developer.

You will need following things:
* Linux computer
* General text editor
* Version Control
* python (duh...)
* Browser

## Linux
When I talk about linux I mean UNIX based system. As most of servers are based
on one linux distro or other it is a base requirement for developer to learn Linux.

That is why I enforce using it as development machine and using it from command line
for that matter. This will provide you with necessary skills to manage when you
start working with actual web servers through SSH.

There is [plenty of Linux distros](http://distrowatch.com/) and you may choose any one
of them. However for to aid a newbie I will recommend to use [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/).

>Note: OSX is UNIX based system as well.

## Text Editor
You need something to write code with. A basic text editor is just fine for this purpose. Yes,
Notepad (or gedit as this is Linux) will work just fine for coding. Unlike you might have imagined
programming is just writing text files, not magic, and you won't need anything special for it.

That being said, there are text editors that specialise in programming and that way make
writing code with them fast, efficient and generally a pleasure. From these editors
there [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are propably
most famous ones. These editors have been in active use for decades and time and time again
developers are [flogging into the ranks of these editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war).

I do not recommend a starting programmer student to start using these behemoths though. Reason is simple
learning curve for both these editors equals to climbing mt. Everest after leg amputation (translation: _not fun_).
However I do recommend everyone to learn one of them at some point of their career. For being one
in the pack and secondly because they are the best terminal based editors available.

[Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is very good editor as well and made completely for writing
python and if all you ever did is writing python, then I would recommend it. However as you are studying
programming and not just python, I do recommend a general purpose editor like [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

__So please install [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)__


## Version Control
You need to save your code somehow. You do it for you essays in school already, you have them in all kind of places. You have essay_final.txt
on you computer, essay_final_final.txt on your thumbdrive and essay_this_is_really_the_final_one.txt on your laptop. You see the problem here?

For programming, even more so than your essays, it's imperetive to save your work. So why not use dropbox? Reason is that we don't just want to
save it, we want to control it specifically. We want to have several people to work on single files, we want to go back on changes done
on files and we want to have it all available now. This is where version control comes in.

There is several version control systems but best (and most difficult to grasp) is [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). Git might be
mind bogling at the beginning but when you graps how it works it will let you become the
[benevolent dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) of your code.

## Python
You will have python pre-installed by your system in almost all cases. Unless you are using Windows, in which case
you should uninstall it (Windows, not python).

Generally you should know there is two main versions of python, 2 and 3. 3 is where things are generally going towards
and there starts currently to be quite large adoption of it. However still in 2016 python2 is the main python laguage
and when talking about python we do refer to python2.

## Browser
Something to browse web for guides (like this one) and to checkout your own newly created web pages. This can be almost any
browser. However Firefox and Chrome tend to have best developer tools. From these two I myself use Chrome for development.
