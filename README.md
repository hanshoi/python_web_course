# Python Web Course
Learn python web development and become awesome while doing it.

## Introduction
I have designed this course to be comprehensive course from a complete beginner to a junior level python web developer.
Given the large scope of subjects we will go through in this course will we not go in quite deep details. Also I don't
provide this as all in all solution to become web developer but as a general guideline for learning the skills I
believe is necessary to learn the profession. With this I mean that I don't provide everything on this site but may
refer to other sites and tutorials for further information or guidance.

We are approaching teaching by giving as much freedom related tools and systems you are using. However for sake of
simplicity we are using certain sets of tools and operating systems in our guides. You can ignore these as you please and
use something else.

This guide is designed to be a general guide for self study and as course material for mentor based studying.
